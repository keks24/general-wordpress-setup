# ModSecurity deals with most denial of service attacks by monitoring how many images and
# other high-bandwidth resources are sent per unit time. It doesn't block requests that
# result in multiple 301 redirects or errors

# example:
# 59.58.137.162 - - [10/Aug/2014:07:42:25 +0100] "GET /2013/ HTTP/1.1" 301 478 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0"
